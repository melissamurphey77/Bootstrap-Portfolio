      <p>Best.Advice.Ever. Amirite? So, with that being said...
      <p>Hello! My name is Melissa. I am a graphic artist and a budding web developer.  Art, design and creativity has been my passion since my first 8ct. of Crayola Crayons.  Now I get to transfer that creativity here.  I am excited to start this new journey in my career.  I enjoy painting, audiobooks, and laughing and/or crying about my epic pinterest fails.  I was born and raised in Kansas City and am a proud Mama of an 8yr old who keeps me busy making slime.</p>
